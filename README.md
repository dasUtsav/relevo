# Relevo

Relevo provides a remotely accessible web application to keep track of and manage the inventory records of an organisation, all on a single platform. Verified users log in to manage, add and transfer inventory while also giving feedback on specific inventory items within labs or rooms. A secure, remotely accessible database records all the changes occurring in the inventory list hosted on mlab.Inc, a MongoDB hosting site.
